    <h3><span>Title: </span>ChatApp : Instant Messaging Web Application with End to End Encryption and Self-Healing Architecture to Handle Burst Traffic
</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>This chapter includes the motivation behind the project and 
the background needed to successfully complete the project. 
It also includes the literature survey that has been done, organization of the thesis, and resources used in our project.
 Initially the theoretical knowledge needed for the project is acquired.
 Then a suitable development environment is selected.
 After that the various possible situations are studied, enhanced and summarized in the development environment.
 The aim of this project is to study, and design a pilot project as a proof of stated concepts.
 The main aim is to design an instant messaging application solving the problem as stated in the abstract.
 This project studies various concepts of web application solving as starred in the abstract. 
And in the end propose a robust and reliable design for an instant messaging application having end to end
 encryption with self-healing server to provide best possible deterrence to a sudden burst in traffic based on the real time health of the server as whole.</h3>
